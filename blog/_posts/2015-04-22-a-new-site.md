Our new lab website is up and running. My goal with this is to replace stock website github somehow
made for us -- it had no content and looked ugly. If it results in discussion on topics of interest,
is convenient in any way, or brings greater publicity - great. If not, at least we do what all other
groups have been doing as of late.
